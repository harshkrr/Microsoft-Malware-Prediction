# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
Our task is to predict whether a PC has Malware or not based on certain given information. We have a labelled dataset which contained around 9 million training and 8 million data, so we selected a subset of it. We selected 1 million as test data, 0.5 million as validation data and 0.5 million as test data. We used EDA techniques for data preprocessing. We also used feature engineering to engineer some new features and remove redundant features. Finally, we used various methods and models to train and then tuned the parameters for better test results
